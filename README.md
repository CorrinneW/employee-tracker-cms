# Employee Tracker CMS
Add and update employees, roles and departments of a business with this command line app made with mySQL, inquirer and Node.js

## The Goal
A Node.js content management system that uses mySQL to add and update employees, their roles, salaries and departments.

## What I Did
1. Starting with seed data, built a mySQL database with tables for employees, roles and departments.
2. Made a series of inquirer prompts to navigate the user through the app.
3. Created functions for various actions using Node.js to interact with the mySQL database via queries.
